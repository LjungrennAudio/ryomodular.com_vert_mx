 yet another new ryomodule - thi time the lon overdue vertmix mixer

2408302315

this is the repo for the ryodular.com vert_mx urorack format modular synth mixer module.

its been around as a prototypefor near 13 years and even visible on mod grid etc. yet never released so i guess it's about time really...

it's not much exciting am afraid - a 3 channel mixer with attenu version on each channel as well asbreakout signal option to allow just utility use without being used as a mixer.

it will  be available in ht new white panel/gold markings n pink knobs plus green leds along with the traditional ryo colourscheme too.
it should  be a pretty low price basic beginner DIY build friendly kinda module as oer ryo's traditional so far iutput so may not catch as much attention as the other new modules in the lineup but i feel c9mpelled to bring this cha[pter to closure at whatever cost the way things seem to be going. : D

if anyone cn come up with real exciting patch progaramming uses or unusuial thoughts for patch examples please tell me cos am not super inspired by thios one tbh - it's absolutely an essential you cnt do without in a system but it's not exactly the kimda thing you shout about - it just sits queitly in the corner doing it's job and eing an unsung hero of the modular ecosystem.

this will be cheap, unexciting and solid. it needs to e there as oart of the lineup but its not a weird quirky one or some kind of flagship - it just is.


202501080338 addendum


this is p much exactly the same story as the repos for the other modules of the set 'vert_mx, dp_switch, adda. brit_eq5', - i.e. it's not finished until it's finished and i aint attempting to bring order to chaos until it's all over so for now this aint gonna be sereing alotta change except for even more files being added. sorro.

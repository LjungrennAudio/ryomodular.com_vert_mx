clocking with FWD clock input the sequence will advance one step forward - clockable to very high clock rates (100 kHz tested) In cv mode the one that shares the forward clock input is half wave rectified CVable with to audio range

step forward button will advance the sequence  one step forward

clocking with REV clock input will advance one step in reverse - clockable to very high clock rates (100 kHz tested) In cv mode the reverse clock input is full wave rectified, CVable with full audio range

Step Rev button will advance the sequence one step in reverse


If a clock comes in exactly at the same time on both inputs the forward will have priority over the reverse.
 

The steps toggle switch and the red buttons are inactive in CV mode.

To limit the number of steps in CV mode you can use an attenuator to attenuate the CV down to only reach 2 or 3 steps.
